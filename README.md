# GANFT
Generation routine for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by means of Generative Networks.

# 1. Problem

## 1.1. General Description
This is usually done by using algorithms that tries all different combinations of a given set of layers. Indeed for simple images, i.e. 8 to 24-bit color images, we can simply think of using:
* a set of images specifying the background, say it B1, B2, etc.,
* a set of images specifying different features of the subject, say it F1, F2, F3, etc.(e.g. hats, glasses, shoes, etc.)
Once provided the this sets, which define the layers that create the final image, we have to combine them in a certain way. It makes sense, if the number of unique sets is small, to try all the different combinations and take the images created that seems the most promising. Since we are talking about NFTs the objective is to create a sufficient amount of images to insert in the blockchain. 

## 1.2 Generative Neural Networks
Until now, we have provided a way of solving the problem of creating simple NFTs by means of a brute-force approach, which is ideal if we think of simple images. Obviously, in order to make this work it is necessary to provide sufficiently good images to be layered, i.e. created by artists. 

To overcome this, it comes handy some of the works produced in the Neural Networks literature, especially *Generative Adversarial Networks* (GANs), *Cycle GANs*, etc.

### 1.2.1 Architecture Implementation
Missing part.

# 2. Milestones:

1. Creating the dataset. 
2. Create the model.
3. Train on the dataset.
4. Use the aforementioned model to create NFTs.
5. Upload them in the blockchain.
